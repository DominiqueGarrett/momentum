## Description
  Momentum is a full-stack site where users can drop pushpin location markers in the 3 most popular cities in Texas. With login authentication, logged-in users have access to the dashboard where they can save a location and write a description. Additionallly, this application is MVC structured and makes use of multiple packages such as handlebars, bcrypt, express.sessions, sequelize and more to ensure the most optimized experience.


## User Story
```
AS A person who is new to the area
I WANT to view and save the places I visit
SO THAT I can keep record of the places I enjoy most while exploring a city
```


## Acceptance Criteria 
```
GIVEN an option to select between: Austin, Dallas or Houston
WHEN I double click the map
THEN a pushpin is dropped/displays on the map
WHEN the pushpin is dropped the coordinates are saved
THEN I am able to enter a name and description
WHEN I log back it at another time, my saved locations, name and description will be there
```


## Installation
  1. To install application, clone the main project via the HTTP or SSH link on github.

```
git clone <SSH>
```

2. Once cloned, open up the project folder in your text editor and run the following command in terminal to install all dependencies.

## Setup
Create an '.env' file in the main directory path and include the following data:

```
DB_NAME='cities_db'
